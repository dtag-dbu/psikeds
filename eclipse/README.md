ECLIPSE TEMPLATES
-----------------
For those, who are very familiar with Eclipse and who prefer to create/optimize
the Eclipse-Project-Files manually, there are Templates included in this
directory.

1. Copy the Files *".project"*, *".classpath"* and the directory *".settings"* with
   all its contents to each psiKeds-Component-Subdirectory that includes a
   Maven *pom.xml*

2. Edit each .project and specify the Project's Name from Maven-POM as Name
   for the Eclipse-Project

3. Within Eclipse select *"Import Existing Projects into Workspace"*
